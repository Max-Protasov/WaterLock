# Welcome WaterLock repo!

This application was designed for Samsung Galaxy S series (with **waterproof**), but may also work with your phone.


## How it works?

This app has no launcher, so after install you need to add an application tile to your taskbar. After activating tile your screen will be locked from any/sudden touches. To disable this click again to tile (or reboot your device, some bugs're included;)


## Any requirements?

This application does **NOT** collect your data or use the Internet, so don't worry. This apk was designed to use **only** with **waterproof** devices to record videos under water. Also, you can use it with any water-resistant cases (like you may see on AliExpress).

## Payment/Feedback/Ideas/Any usage

This application is totally **free**, but (obviously) all donations are welcome) To live a feedback or if you have an idea, welcome to my TG (t.me/PowerOfTheCosmos (English/Russian/German/French)).
In case you'd like to use this anywhere in your projects, please put my authorship somewhere, or, if it's convinient, notify me.
For bugs open a new issue and I'll try to help. Any forks/stars are welcome!)
